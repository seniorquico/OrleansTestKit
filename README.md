The Orleans TestKit is an easy-to-use toolkit for unit testing the grain logic of applications built with [Microsoft Orleans](http://dotnet.github.io/orleans/). The Orleans TestKit is intended to augment the [`TestCluster` unit testing approach](http://dotnet.github.io/orleans/Documentation/tutorials_and_samples/testing.html) provided by the official `Microsoft.Orleans.TestingHost` NuGet package.

**The Orleans TestKit is evolving to meet the demands of the team. If you have a question or need, please [ask us](https://github.com/OrleansContrib/OrleansTestKit/issues/new)!**

## Installation

Simply install the `OrleansTestKit` NuGet package in your project to get started. For example, run the following command in your Visual Studio Package Manager Console:

```
PM> Install-Package OrleansTestKit
```

## Documentation

Examples are provided by the included [test project](https://github.com/OrleansContrib/OrleansTestKit/tree/master/test).

### Known Limitations

When run within a test kit environment, code that calls the `GetPrimaryKey` extension methods sometimes result in an `ArgumentException` with the following message:

> Passing a half baked grain as an argument. It is possible that you instantiated a grain class explicitly, as a regular object and not via Orleans runtime or via proper test mocking.

See the [`GetPrimaryKey` Limitation docs](./docs/getprimarykey-limitation.md) for more information and potential workarounds.
